  Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the "root" account
description: >
  The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of
  protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to
  an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
  authentication code from their AWS MFA device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the
  root account be protected with a hardware MFA.
