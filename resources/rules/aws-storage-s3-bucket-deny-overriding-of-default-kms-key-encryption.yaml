  Ensure S3 bucket deny overriding of default KMS Key encryption
description: >
  Attackers which have S3:PutObject permission are still able to override default KMS Key encryption
  on updating object operation with their own provided KMS Key, thus lead ransomware violation
  Bucket owner should define policy to allow objects modification only using the defined default KMS Key,
  which attack unlikely have permissions to change or modify
