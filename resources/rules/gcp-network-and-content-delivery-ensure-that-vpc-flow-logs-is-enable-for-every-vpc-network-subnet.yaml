  Ensure that VPC Flow Logs is enabled for every subnet in a VPC Network
description: >
  Flow Logs is a feature that enables users to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in the organization's VPC Subnets.
  Once a flow log is created, the user can view and retrieve its data in Stackdriver Logging.
  It is recommended that Flow Logs be enabled for every business-critical VPC subnet.
