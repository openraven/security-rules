  Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
description: >
  A VPC comes with a default security group whose initial settings deny all inbound traffic,
  allow all outbound traffic, and allow all traffic between instances assigned to the security
  group. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is
  automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful
  filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the
  default security group restrict all traffic.
  The default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply.
  Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need
  remediation to comply with this recommendation.
