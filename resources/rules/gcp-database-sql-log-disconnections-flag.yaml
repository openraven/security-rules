  Ensure that the 'log_disconnections' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'
description: >
  PostgreSQL does not log session details such as duration and session end by default.
  Enabling the log_disconnections setting will create log entries at the end of each session
  which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and determine any unusual activity across a time period.
  The log_disconnections and log_connections work hand in hand and generally, the pair would be enabled/disabled together.
  By default log_disconnections is off.
