  Ensure that S3 Bucket has MFA option enabled for changing Bucket Versioning settings and permanently deleting object versions
description: >
  S3 Buckets should be protected from ransomware attacks, by configuring versioning and MFA Delete,
  in order to disallow immediate bucket content removal to encryption, or any other harmful modifications
  Disabled versioning is also considered as violation by this rule since attacker may make the bucket vulnerable
  by disabling object versioning with the s3:PutBucketVersioning permission
