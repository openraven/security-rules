  Ensure 'log_hostname' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set appropriately
description: >
  Logging hostnames can incur overhead on server performance as for each statement logged,
  DNS resolution will be required to convert IP address to hostname.
  Depending on the setup, this may be non-negligible.
  Additionally, the IP addresses that are logged can be resolved to their DNS names later
  when reviewing the logs excluding the cases where dynamic hostnames are used.
  By default log_hostname is off.
