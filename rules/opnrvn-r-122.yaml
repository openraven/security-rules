  Ensure that the 'log_lock_waits' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'
description: >
  Enabling the log_lock_waits flag for a PostgreSQL instance creates a log
  for any session waits that take longer than the alloted deadlock_timeout time to acquire a lock.
  This can be used to identify poor performance due to locking delays
  or if a specially-crafted SQL is attempting to starve resources through holding locks for excessive amounts of time
  By default log_lock_waits is off.
